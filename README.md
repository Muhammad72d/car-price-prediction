# Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of a car based on features like brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage using regression models.

---

##  Project Description

We built machine learning models to estimate used car prices using a structured dataset. The project involved feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Models Used
- Linear Regression
---

##  Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned missing and inconsistent data
3. Encoded categorical features (e.g., brand, transmission)
4. Performed feature scaling (e.g., mileage, year)
5. Trained and evaluated multiple regression models
6. Compared performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score
7. Selected the best-performing model

---

##  Performance
- Linear Regression has acheived a great target so it was enough
